_**Important**: The risk calculations here are only for disease transmission  by the airborne aerosol route, and do not account for transmission by droplets  or from contaminated surfaces. The implicit assumption is that appropriate  social distancing and hygiene protocols are strictly adhered to in the classroom.  To the extent that this is not true, the risk of infection will be higher than  predicted by these calculations. Users should also also bear in mind that the  absolute estimates of predicted risk from this model are quite uncertain because  of uncertainties in our knowledge of key parameters such as the exhalation rate  of virion-containing aerosols by infected individuals and the percentage of  infected individuals in the classroom. The model is nevertheless useful to  explore the relative effects of control measures (e.g. more ventilation,  fewer people, shorter duration, masks vs no masks) on COVID-19 transmission  by aerosols in classrooms._
